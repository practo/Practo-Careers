Any name outside of that list is not eligible to give the test. Contact us only if your name is present in the final list and you still haven't received the test invite.


- **\[Oct 12th, 2021 04:25 PM\]** There seems to be some confusion with registrations at Presidency University. If you have filled Practo's Registration Form, you will receive the test invite. If you have filled any other form circulated by your Placement Office, it will not be considered.
We're reaching out to the Placement Office for clarifications.
